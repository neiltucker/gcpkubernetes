### Lab Suggestions:  GCP-430

Introduction to Containers and Docker:
Task: Upload the Image to a Registry, Step 3: Please note that this and the following steps must be done from a new SSH session

Kubernetes Basics:
Task: Bash Completion (Optional), Step 2: Do not copy and paste this command.  Type "kubectl" and press the TAB key on your keyboard twice 
Task: Run and deploy a container, Step 1: Run the command "kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:1.10.0" 
Task: Interacting with pods: Please read the instructions carefully.  You will be running commands in three (3) different terminals during this task.

Deploying to Kubernetes:
Task: Create a Deployment, Step 8: The commands in this step might need to be run a few times to get the intended output.  Wait a few seconds before retrying a command.
By default, every request has a chance to be served by the canary deployment. If you want users to get all their responses from the same version, enable session affinity in the configuration file as follows:
spec:
sessionAffinity: ClientIP

Continuous Deployment with Jenkins:
Task: Create a Service Account with permissions, Step 5: Make a note of the download location for the jenkins-sa-key.json file for later tasks
Task: Install Helm, Step 4: After this step, run the command: "./helm repo update"
Task: Connect to Jenkins, Step 1: This command will display the Jenkins password for the admin account  
Task: Create a repository to host the sample app source code, Step 4: the code box after "git remote -v" is output and should not be used as code.
Task: Create the Jenkins job, Step 4: Do you use this command, but the output from running the command in Cloud Shell
Task: Modifying the pipeline definition: Be very careful of changes made to the configuration files.  Syntax is very important.  If you are uncomfortable using vi or nano, choose the GUI editor in Cloud Shell by clicking "Open Editor" in the upper right hand corner of the Cloud Shell Terminal

Continuous Deployment withSpinnaker
Task: Creating a cluster for Spinnaker operation, Step 6:  This step runs a script that installs Spinnaker and will take a few minutes to complete.  Do not perform Step 7 (Restart Cloud Shell) until this step is complete.
